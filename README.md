# Transfer_Learning_NLP_TF_Hub
This is a hands-on project on transfer learning for natural language processing with TensorFlow and TF Hub. 
In this project I used pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub, perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on real-world data, 
build and evaluate multiple models for text classification with TensorFlow, and visualize model performance metrics with Tensorboard.
